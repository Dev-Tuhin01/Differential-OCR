# Differential Equation OCR using Typescript

This is a college project focused on developing an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool that can recognize handwritten differential equations using Typescript programming language.

The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that will allow users to take an image of a handwritten differential equation and have it converted to a digital format that can be easily edited and manipulated.

The project is being developed using Typescript, a popular and powerful programming language that is used for creating large-scale web applications. It will also leverage machine learning techniques such as image recognition to accurately identify and transcribe the handwritten equations.

This project is intended to be a useful tool for students and researchers in the field of mathematics and engineering who need to work with differential equations. It will be an open-source project, allowing for contributions and improvements from the wider community.
